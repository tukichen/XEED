Parkinson’s disease affects the nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine. Parkinson’s disease symptoms include muscle rigidity, tremors, and changes in speech and gait. After diagnosis, treatments can help relieve symptoms, but there is no cure.


### Wearable device for Monitoring Parkinson's disease symptoms 
A startup Company XEED develops wearables to monitor and log motion disorders. Motion data collected on limbs are synchronized to an app. I develop machine learning algorithms to classify the on, off and dyskinia states and occurances of tremor, so that patient can understand how daily activities and treatment affect their symptoms.

### Machine Learning
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models to track the type and severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms over time, so that physicians can track progress of their patients and adjust treatment to eventually delay disease progression.

### Design and Data
Patients and controls wear XEED devices on their limbs. Acceleration and orientation data 32 times per second. Parkison's symptoms and subject activities such as resting and walking are recorded and used a labels to 
1. Identify walking periods; 
2. Detect differences in walking features between PD patients and controls
