Parkinson’s disease affects the nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine. Parkinson’s disease symptoms include muscle rigidity, tremors, and changes in speech and gait. After diagnosis, treatments can help relieve symptoms, but there is no cure.


A startup Company XEED develops wearables to monitor and log motion disorders. Motion data collected on limbs are synchronized to an app. I develop machine learning algorithms to classify the on, off and dyskinia states and occurances of tremor, so that patient can understand how daily activities and treatment affect their symptoms.
